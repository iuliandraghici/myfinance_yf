SOLID are a set of 5 programming principles, especially directed to Object Oriented Programming. Each letter represent a principle.

S - Single Responsibility Principle -> every class function should perform a single functionality

    -> functions
			-> wrong: a function edits an element in a DB and deletes another element
			-> right: a function edits an element in a DB, a different function deletes an element from DB
	
	-> classes
			-> wrong: a class reads/writes to a DB and reads/writes to a file
			-> right: a class has the responsibility to manage interactions with a DB (read & write), another class does this for a file

O - Open Closed Principle -> classes/functions should be open for extension, but closed to change

L - Liskov Substitution Principle -> I can use a child class exactly as I can use the parent class

I - Interface Seggregation Principle -> a caller of a class should not depend on functions it does not use

D - Dependency Injection Principle -> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

    -> for example, we can have a shopping app
			-> classes which represent the products we sell should not know which DB we use
			-> if we change the DB, we should make no change in our product classes (or very minimal changes)
